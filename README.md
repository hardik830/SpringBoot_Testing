# Spring Boot Unit Testing with JUnit 5

## Overview

This repository showcases my learning journey through the course **Spring Boot Unit Testing with JUnit 5, Mocks, and MockMvc**. Taught by the renowned instructor **Chad Darby**, this course provided in-depth knowledge and hands-on experience in testing Spring Boot applications, emphasizing best practices for building robust applications.

## Skills Acquired

Throughout this course, I developed a variety of skills essential for unit testing and ensuring software quality:

### 1. JUnit 5 Proficiency
- Mastered the development and execution of JUnit tests.
- Applied various assertions such as equality, null checks, and boolean conditions.
- Utilized lifecycle annotations and custom display names for enhanced test readability.
- Managed exceptions effectively and defined execution order for tests.

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Implemented TDD principles by writing tests before coding.
- Created failing tests to drive the implementation of functional code.
- Leveraged parameterized tests for testing a range of input scenarios.

### 3. Spring Boot Testing
- Employed `@SpringBootTest` and `@TestPropertySource` for application context configuration.
- Tested application properties and injected configuration values seamlessly.
- Asserted conditions on Spring Boot beans to ensure expected behavior.

### 4. Mocking with Mockito
- Identified appropriate scenarios for mocking dependencies during testing.
- Used the `@MockBean` annotation for dependency injection in tests.
- Threw and handled exceptions effectively using mock objects.

### 5. Database Integration Testing
- Set up embedded databases for efficient testing.
- Ensured clean database states with `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` annotations.
- Utilized external SQL scripts with the `@Sql` annotation for data setup.

### 6. Testing MVC Web Apps with MockMvc
- Applied testing techniques for Spring MVC CRUD web applications.
- Configured and injected `MockMvc` for effective controller testing.
- Sent HTTP requests and asserted view names and model attributes to validate behavior.

### 7. Testing REST APIs with MockMvc
- Conducted thorough tests for Spring REST CRUD APIs.
- Leveraged Jackson Object Mapper for effective JSON data handling.
- Validated response content types and JSON structures for API correctness.

### 8. Understanding Microservice Architecture
- Gained insights into building and testing applications suited for microservices.
- Recognized the importance of robust testing practices in microservice environments.

## Conclusion

This course has significantly enhanced my skills in unit testing and reinforced my understanding of Spring Boot applications. I look forward to applying these skills in real-world projects and exploring further opportunities in software development.

## Future Learning

I aim to delve into more advanced topics such as **Microservices** üõ†Ô∏è and **Apache Kafka** üì®, which are becoming increasingly pivotal in today's tech landscape.
