## <span style="color:#E67E22">🎯 Key Skills Acquired</span>

### <span style="color:#27AE60">1. 🧪 JUnit 5 Mastery</span>
- **Developed and executed unit tests** with JUnit 5.
- Applied advanced **assertions** (e.g., equals, null, true/false).
- Utilized lifecycle annotations (`@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`) and custom display names.
- Handled exceptions and managed **test execution order**.

### <span style="color:#27AE60">2. 📝 Test-Driven Development (TDD)</span>
- Followed the **TDD cycle**: Red -> Green -> Refactor.
- Developed tests before implementing code for better design and code quality.
- **Parameterized tests** for covering multiple input scenarios efficiently.

### <span style="color:#27AE60">3. 🔧 Spring Boot Testing</span>
- Configured comprehensive testing environments with `@SpringBootTest` and `@TestPropertySource`.
- Verified application properties and injected dependencies during testing.
- Validated Spring Boot **bean behavior** for consistency and correctness.

### <span style="color:#27AE60">4. 🤖 Mockito for Mocking Dependencies</span>
- Utilized **Mockito** to isolate unit tests from external dependencies.
- Injected mock objects using `@MockBean` and verified interactions.
- Effectively handled **exception scenarios** within mocks.

### <span style="color:#27AE60">5. 🗃️ Database Integration Testing</span>
- Configured and used **embedded databases** (H2) for integration tests.
- Managed test data lifecycle with `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`.
- Leveraged `@Sql` for executing external SQL scripts during testing.

### <span style="color:#27AE60">6. 🌐 Spring MVC Testing with MockMvc</span>
- Developed tests for **Spring MVC applications**, including CRUD operations.
- Simulated HTTP requests and validated **controller responses**.
- Asserted correct model attributes and view names for thorough testing.

### <span style="color:#27AE60">7. 🖥️ REST API Testing with MockMvc</span>
- Implemented **unit tests** for Spring REST APIs.
- Utilized **Jackson Object Mapper** to handle JSON data for requests and responses.
- Asserted response content types, status codes, and JSON structure for APIs.

### <span style="color:#27AE60">8. 🔄 Testing in Microservice Architecture</span>
- Gained foundational knowledge for testing applications within a **microservice architecture**.
- Understood the critical role of testing in ensuring **reliable and scalable** distributed systems.

## <span style="color:#9B59B6">💼 Professional Insights</span>

This course has strengthened my understanding of essential **unit testing practices** for Spring Boot applications, including how to test microservices in distributed environments. I now possess a solid grasp of **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **MockMvc**, and **Mockito**, which will allow me to create more reliable, maintainable, and scalable applications.
